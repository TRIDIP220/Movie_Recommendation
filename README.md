# Welcome to Streamlit ðŸ‘‹

**A faster way to build and share data apps.**

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. Itâ€™s all Python, open-source, and free! And once youâ€™ve created an app you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud)Â to deploy, manage, and share your app.


## Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello
```

If this opens our sweet _Streamlit Hello_ app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to [our docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) for specific installs.

The app features a bunch of examples of what you can do with Streamlit. Jump to the [quickstart](#quickstart) section to understand how that all works.

## Quickstart

### A little example

Create a new file `streamlit_app.py` with the following code:
```python
import streamlit as st
x = st.slider("Select a value")
st.write(x, "squared is", x * x)
```

Now run it to open the app!
```
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
